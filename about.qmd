I am a visiting professor at UCLA. My primary research interest is bringing modern high-performance computing (HPC) techniques to enable statistical analysis of large-scale data. This involves computer-intensive statistical methodology, numerical optimization, development of easy-to-use software, parallel computing for statistical analysis on multi-GPU environments and CPU clusters, and their application to data-driven discovery in bioinformatics and statistical genetics.
